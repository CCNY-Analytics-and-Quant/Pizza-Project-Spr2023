# Pizza-Project-Spr2023
Carter Le

The goal of this project is to see where the opportunities lies in selling the most amount of pizzas. Using SQL, I extracted the data I wanted into CSV from the database. Then, I used Python, matplotlib, and seaborn to graph charts. I used line plots and bar charts to figure out trends in pizza selling. 


Chart Image Description


Chart 1 - Time over the Year vs Pizza Category Sold (Line plot) 

Chart 2 - Time over the Year vs (Top 10) Pizza Type Id Sold (Line plot)

Chart 3 - Time over Day vs (Top 10) Pizza Type Id Sold (Line plot) 

Chart 4 - # of Pizza Type Id Sold subdivided into Pizza Sizes (Stacked Bar Chart) 

Chart 5 - Revenue by Pizza Type (Bar Chart)

Chart 6 - Time over the Year vs Revenue of (Top 10) Pizza Type Id Sold (Line Plot)

Chart 7 - Time over the Year vs Revenue by Pizza Category (Line Plot)

Chart 8 - Time over the Year vs Revenue of (Top 10) Pizza Type Id Sold (Line Plot)




I made these charts one after the other in the order I thought was most necessary. I initially only thought of making Charts 1-5, but when I made Chart 5, I realized I needed to focus on revenue and time.

The presentation did not use all 8 charts and did not use the same order. It was only after making the charts did I figure out what order I should have made them in.
